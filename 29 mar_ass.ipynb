    "Lasso Regression, short for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, is a linear regression technique that combines standard linear regression with L1 regularization.

    "The key difference between Lasso Regression and other regression techniques lies in the type of regularization used:\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 regularization: Lasso Regression applies L1 regularization by adding a penalty term to the standard linear regression loss function. The penalty term is\n",
    "proportional to the sum of the absolute values of the regression coefficients multiplied by a regularization parameter (lambda). This encourages sparsity \n",
    "in the coefficients, driving some coefficients to exactly zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection: Due to L1 regularization, Lasso Regression has the ability to automatically perform feature selection. It selects a subset of the most \n",
