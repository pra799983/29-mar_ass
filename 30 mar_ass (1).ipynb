    "Elastic Net Regression is a regression technique that combines both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization. It was developed to address some limitations \n",
    "of Lasso and Ridge Regression and provide a more flexible approach to regression modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Elastic Net Regression, the regularization term consists of a linear combination of the L1 and L2 penalties, controlled by two hyperparameters: alpha and \n",

    "The main differences between Elastic Net Regression and other regression techniques are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Combined regularization: Elastic Net Regression combines both L1 and L2 regularization, allowing it to benefit from the strengths of both techniques. The L1\n",
    "regularization promotes sparsity, enabling feature selection and removing irrelevant predictors. The L2 regularization encourages coefficient shrinkage, \n",
    "improving stability and handling multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuning parameters: Elastic Net Regression has two hyperparameters to be tuned: alpha and lambda. The alpha parameter controls the balance between L1 and L2\n",

    "\n",
    "Multicollinearity handling: Elastic Net Regression performs well in the presence of multicollinearity, as it inherits the ability of Ridge Regression to\n",

    "Feature selection: Elastic Net Regression can perform feature selection, similar to Lasso Regression, by setting some coefficients to exactly zero. \n",

    "Cross-Validation: Employ k-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the Elastic Net Regression model for different combinations of alpha and \n",
